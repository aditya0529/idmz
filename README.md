# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with Python.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!


. CDK Application Initialization and Multi-Region Deployment
Application Entry Point (app.py)
The application starts in app.py, which serves as the entry point for the CDK application:

Environment Profile Determination:
The code first determines the environment profile (develop, qa, or live) based on environment variables.
It prioritizes CDK_ENV_PROFILE, then falls back to SRC_BRANCH, and defaults to develop.
Properties Loading:
Loads the INI-style properties file (resources/application.{env_profile}.properties) using Utility.load_properties().
This file contains both global settings ([cdk_settings]) and region-specific configurations (e.g., [eu-central-1]).
Multi-Region Deployment Loop:
Extracts target_regions from the [cdk_settings] section.
Iterates through each target region to create region-specific stacks.
For Each Region:
Calls CustomSynthesizer.build_synthesizer(env_profile, region) to configure the CDK environment for the current region.
Creates an IDMZNetworkStack instance with a region-specific ID.
Creates a GlobalAPIGWStack instance, passing the outputs from the network stack.
Applies global tags to all stacks.
CDK Synthesis:
Applies cdk-nag checks for security and best practices.
Calls app.synth() to synthesize the CloudFormation templates.
2. Custom Synthesizer (CustomSynthesizer.py)
   The CustomSynthesizer class handles the region-specific configuration:

Configuration Merging:
Loads the properties file.
Merges global settings from [cdk_settings] with region-specific overrides from [{region}].
Populates Utility.cdk_custom_configs with the merged configuration.
Validation:
Ensures all required keys for the synthesizer are present.
Validates that the configured stack_deploy_region matches the target region.
Environment Creation:
Creates a cdk.Environment with the account and region.
Creates a cdk.DefaultStackSynthesizer with bootstrap roles and resources.
3. Network Infrastructure (IDMZNetworkStack)
   The IDMZNetworkStack establishes the network foundation:

VPC Configuration:
Originally designed to create a new VPC, but now imports an existing VPC using _import_existing_vpc().
The VPC ID is retrieved from the region-specific configuration.
Security Groups:
Creates several security groups:
sg_ir: Incident Response security group
sg_vpce: VPC Endpoint security group
sg_nlb: Network Load Balancer security group
sg_vpclink: VPC Link security group
Security Group Rules:
Configures traffic flow between components:
NLB → VPCE: Allows TCP/443 traffic from NLB to VPCE
VPCLink → NLB: Allows TCP/443 traffic from VPC Link to NLB
NACL Configuration:
The _configure_nacl() method is defined but not called when using an imported VPC.
When used, it would deny inbound traffic on ports 22 and 3389 from 0.0.0.0/0 for security.
4. API Gateway Infrastructure (GlobalAPIGWStack)
   The GlobalAPIGWStack builds the API Gateway and related components:

Custom Domain Creation:
Creates an ACM certificate for the API domain.
Sets up a custom domain with mTLS support using uploaded certificates.
Creates a Route53 record pointing to the API Gateway custom domain.
VPC Link Creation:
Creates a VPC Link to connect the API Gateway to the VPC.
Associates it with the VPC Link security group.
VPCE Integration Setup:
Calls vpce_helpers.setup_vpce_integration() to set up the VPC Endpoint integration.
This returns an authorizer and NLB listener.
HTTP API Gateway Creation:
Creates an HTTP API with the custom domain, authorizer, and NLB integration.
Sets up logging for the API Gateway.
API Routes Creation:
Calls vpce_helpers.add_http_api_routes() to create routes for the API.
Adds a health check endpoint (/idmzhealth) with a Lambda integration.
Creates routes based on the configuration in the properties file.
5. VPC Endpoint Integration (vpce_helpers.py)
   The vpce_helpers.py module handles the complex integration between API Gateway and VPC Endpoint Service:

VPC Endpoint Creation:
Creates an Interface VPC Endpoint that connects to the VPC Endpoint Service.
Configures security groups and subnets for the endpoint.
Applies VPC Endpoint policies if configured.
Custom Resource for IP Retrieval:
Creates a custom resource with a Lambda function to retrieve private IPs from the VPC Endpoint ENIs.
This is necessary because CloudFormation cannot directly get the IPs from ENIs.
Network Target Group Creation:
Creates a Network Target Group with the private IPs from the VPC Endpoint.
Configures health checks and connection settings.
Network Load Balancer Creation:
Creates an internal Network Load Balancer in the NLB subnets.
Associates it with the NLB security group.
Creates a listener on port 443 (or as configured) forwarding to the target group.
Lambda Authorizer Creation:
Creates a Lambda function for API authorization.
Configures it to use source IP and client certificate for authentication.
HTTP API Routes Creation:
Creates a health check endpoint with a Lambda integration.
Creates routes based on the configuration, using the NLB integration.
6. Traffic Flow
   The traffic flow through the infrastructure follows this path:

External Client → API Gateway:
Client makes a request to the custom domain (e.g., ingress_name.idmz_external_zone_name).
The request is routed to the API Gateway through the Route53 record.
mTLS authentication is performed using client certificates.
API Gateway → Lambda Authorizer:
The API Gateway invokes the Lambda authorizer.
The authorizer validates the client's source IP and certificate.
API Gateway → VPC Link → NLB:
If authorized, the request is forwarded through the VPC Link to the NLB.
The VPC Link security group allows traffic to the NLB (TCP/443).
NLB → VPC Endpoint:
The NLB forwards the request to the VPC Endpoint's private IPs.
The NLB security group allows traffic to the VPCE (TCP/443).
VPC Endpoint → VPC Endpoint Service:
The VPC Endpoint forwards the request to the VPC Endpoint Service in another account.
The request includes the TLS server name (vpce_service_tls_fqdn).
Response Path:
The response follows the reverse path back to the client.
7. Security Controls
   Several security controls are implemented throughout the infrastructure:

Network Isolation:
The VPC uses private subnets for all components.
No internet gateway is created.
Components are placed in separate subnets with specific security groups.
Authentication and Authorization:
mTLS is required for API Gateway access.
Lambda authorizer validates client certificates and source IPs.
Security Groups:
Precise security group rules control traffic flow between components.
Default deny-all for both ingress and egress (allow_all_outbound=False).
Compliance Checks:
cdk-nag checks are applied to identify security issues.
Suppressions are documented with reasons where exceptions are needed.
Logging:
API Gateway logs are configured with detailed information.
Lambda functions have log retention policies.
8. Multi-Region Support
   The application is designed for multi-region deployment:

Region-Specific Configuration:
Each region has its own section in the properties file.
Region-specific values override global settings.
Region-Aware Resource Names:
Stack IDs include the region name (e.g., IDMZ-Network-Stack-{region}).
Resource names include region identifiers.
Independent Deployments:
Each region's stacks are independent but share the same code.
Region-specific AWS environments and synthesizers are created.
This end-to-end flow demonstrates a sophisticated CDK application that creates a secure API Gateway infrastructure with VPC Endpoint integration, designed for multi-region deployment. The architecture ensures secure traffic flow between components while maintaining isolation and applying best practices for security and compliance.
